## Description

This is a project on the influence of demographic characteristics on
COVID-19 kinetics, which was performed as a part of “R for Bio Data
Science” at DTU in the spring of 2020. The project includes an
exploratory data analyses, survival analysis, PCA clustering, and a
Shiny app developed on the data.

## Data

The data for this project includes COVID-19 data from Johns Hopkins
University
(<https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data>)
combined with publicly available data on population demographics, public
health measures, health system capacity, COVID-19 tests, and
cause-specific mortality for countries around the world. These
additional data has been retrieved from the World Health Organization
(<https://www.who.int/data/gho>), United Nations (<http://data.un.org/>)
and Our World in Data (<https://ourworldindata.org/>). Data has been
updated with follow-up until May 4th 2020.

Original data is available in this repository in /data/\_raw

## List of variables

**number\_of\_confirmed\_covid-19**: Number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.

**number\_of\_covid-19\_related\_deaths**: Number of confirmed COVID-19
related deaths.

**recovered\_from\_covid-19\_no.**: Number of recovered cases of
COVID-19.

**adult\_mortality\_rate**: The probability of dying between the ages of
15 and 60 years (per 1 000 population) per year among a hypothetical
cohort of 100 000 people that would experience the age-specific
mortality rate of the reporting year.
