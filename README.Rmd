Data has been updated with follow-up until May 4th 2020.


### Field description

#### Data source - Johns Hopkins University (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data)

number_of_confirmed_covid-19: Number of confirmed COVID-19 cases

number_of_covid-19_related_deaths: Number of confirmed COVID-19 related deaths

recovered_from_covid-19_no.: Number of recovered cases of COVID-19

#### Data source - WHO

adult_mortality_rate: The probability of dying between the ages of 15 and 60 years (per 1 000 population) per year among a hypothetical cohort of 100 000 people that would experience the age-specific mortality rate of the reporting year. 

concentration_fine_particles: The mean annual concentration of fine suspended particles of less than 2.5 microns in diameters is a common measure of air pollution. The mean is a population-weighted average for urban population in a country.

bmi_above30_prevalence_all: Percentage of defined population with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or higher.  

proportion_basic_handwashing_facilities: The percentage of population living in households that have a handwashing facility with soap and water at home. 

current_health_expenditure_per_person_usd: Level of general government expenditure on health (GGHE) expressed as a percentage of total government expenditure.

density_of_hospitals: 

density_of_medical_doctors: Medical doctors per 10000 inhabitants.
