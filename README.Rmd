## Description
This is a project on the influence of demographic characteristics on COVID-19 kinetics, which was performed as a part of "R for Bio Data Science" at DTU in the spring of 2020. The project includes an exploratory data analyses, survival analysis, PCA clustering, and a Shiny app developed on the data.


## Data
The data for this project includes COVID-19 data from Johns Hopkins University (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data) combined with publicly available data on population demographics, public health measures, health system capacity, COVID-19 tests, and cause-specific mortality for countries around the world. These additional data has been retrieved from the World Health Organization (https://www.who.int/data/gho), United Nations (http://data.un.org/) and Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/). Data has been updated with follow-up until May 4th 2020. 

Original data is available in this repository in /data/_raw


## List of variables
**number_of_confirmed_covid-19**: Number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.

**number_of_covid-19_related_deaths**: Number of confirmed COVID-19 related deaths.

**recovered_from_covid-19_no.**: Number of recovered cases of COVID-19.

**adult_mortality_rate**: The probability of dying between the ages of 15 and 60 years (per 1 000 population) per year among a hypothetical cohort of 100 000 people that would experience the age-specific mortality rate of the reporting year.
