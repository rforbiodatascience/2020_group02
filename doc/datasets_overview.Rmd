## Datasets
#Johns Hopkins COVID19 
time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv, time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv

Observations: Country
Variables: Confirmed cases/deaths by date 

Cleaning:
Convert to case-by-date tibble by country (tidy dataset using pivotlonger())
Compile state observations within countries 
Merge confirmed cases and confirmed deaths to same dataset
Merge to cleaned WHO data by country (NB! rename differences in country) - Population demographics_2016.csv would be usefull
Merge to cleaned Covid-testing-all-oberservations.csv (data in our world)  



R:
gglot presentation of J. Hopkins data `Confirmed cases by date` and `deaths by date` for countries (worldwide) using geom_col() (it could be nice to relate to both cummulative deaths pr. country and cummlative deaths pr. one mio. citizen)

gglot presentation of J. Hopkins data `Confirmed cases by date` and `deaths by date` related to no of tests performed for each country (Covid-testing-all-oberservations.csv, data in our world)


Global mapp pr√¶sentation of data utilizing the leaflet package


Results:
Shiny app showing the two plots, selecting for country through dropdown and showing facts pr. country in a table format. 

Fancy maps showing distrubition of deaths (both cummulative deaths pr. country and cummlative deaths pr. one)




#Combining WHO, UN and our world in data with COVID-19 data
Observations: Country
Variables: variables possibly affecting cumulative death/spreading speed/etc
Combining all variables (healthcare systems, tobacco, polution, bmi, etc)?

Cleaning:
Defining primary outcomes: time to 100/1000 deaths after firste confirmed death/case
Cleaning each dataset to most recent year?
Pivoting of UN-data?
Merge several cleaned WHO and UN and ? datasets
Merge to cleaned primary outcome-dataset


R:
Plots:
  Gapminder inspired plots for each variable vs primary outcomes
  
PCA combining all variables?

Results:
Shiny app with "gapminde"-plots.
